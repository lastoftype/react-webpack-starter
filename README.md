# My React + Webpack Boilerplate

An extremely simple Webpack/React/Express project shell. I've combined many aspects of other boilerplates into one that I like and find to be pretty easy to use.

## Install

```
npm install
```

On `postinstall` this will run `npm run build`.

## Dev with React hot-loading

```
npm run dev
```

Will run on `localhost:3000`

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Serve

```
node server.js
```

This will run after `npm install`
